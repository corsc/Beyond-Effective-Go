# Beyond Effective Go

Are you a Go programmer with 6+ months experience?

Learned everything you can from [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) and wondered what to learn next?

Then *Beyond Effective Go* is for you.

This book, aimed at competent Gophers, doesnâ€™t mess around with the basics.  Instead, it dives right into the problems the professional programmers face every day.  How to write applications and services that are fast, robust, and able to be maintained and extended as requirements change.

This book focuses on both the programmer and the code by addressing 4 key aspects of Go programming, developer productivity, application performance, code quality, and depth of understanding of the language and tools available.

After reading this book, you will know what aspects of your application or code to focus on and when.  You will have a suite of tools, software patterns, and recipes at your disposal to make your life easier and your code better, faster, and easier to maintain.

## What is going on here?

The code in this repository is the companion code to a book that I am working on.

This book was started a while ago, and due to, well, life issues, it was not completed at that time.

This book was initially titled Advanced Go and was being written under contract with Packt. 
However, because of the delay, this is no longer the case.

I am now attempting to complete this book in my spare time between other work and life commitments.

As you will see by the chapter statuses (below), it is very much a work-in-progress.

With that out of the way, I want to ask for your help.
I find no greater reward for my writing than knowing that I have helped someone learn; thus, I invite you to help me finish this book by reading any of the chapters available below and letting me know what you think.

I am absolutely looking for positive and negative comments (preferably in the form of constructive criticism). 
If something needs more explanation, please tell me. 
If something needs less explanation, please tell me.  
If something needs an example, please tell me.

Like software, the earlier problems are identified, the easier they are to fix.

## Structure

This book is organized into 5 sections:

1. Achieving High-Performance Code
2. Striving for High-Quality Code
3. Exploring the Deeper Parts of Go
4. Building Professional Go Services
5. Building High-Value Shared Libraries

### Section 1: Achieving High-Performance Code
This section focuses on writing blazing fast code because sometimes we need to extract every last drop of performance from our system.

### Section 2: Striving for High-Quality Code
This section discusses how to write code to be eminently readable, maintainable, and extendable.  
In most applications, the quality of the code determines not only how easy it is to maintain and extend and how much we will enjoy doing so.

### Section 3: Exploring the deeper parts of Go
This section aims to deepen our understand of the language and the tooling. It even explores some of the stranger ways we can structure our code and why we might want to do so.

| 9 | Code Generation with Go | Writing | - |

### Section 4: Building Professional Go Services
This section focuses on topics related to building web services.  As this is a very common use-case for Go, particularly for companies, these chapters intend to help the reader produce high-quality, stable, and scalable services.

#### Chapters:
| Chapter | Title | Status | Link |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 10 | Go Service Design and Evolution | Planning | - |
| 11 | Building Resilient Go Services | Planning | - |
| 12 | High-Performance Go Services | Planning | - |
| 13 | Extended Testing for Services | Planning | - |

### Section 5: Building High-Value Shared Libraries
To build great shared libraries takes a lot more than just copy and paste.
This section intends to highlight the issues that arise from building shared libraries and give the reader techniques to deal with them.
